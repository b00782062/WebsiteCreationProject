    <p> So for this one let’s talk about the MiM Application to ESSEC Business School. </p>
    <p>I hope this will be informative enough for someone who’s planning to apply to ESSEC or any other school for that matter as most of the schools have almost the same components. </p>    
    <p>When you apply to a business school for the MiM Programme, there are various components that are considered. But majorly they can be broken down into 5 categories. <br></p>
    <ol><li><strong>Essays and Statement of Purpose</strong> <br><strong>Statement of Purpose –</strong> Now this is the main essay, the statement of purpose, your motivation letter. 
        This is where you have to convince the admission committee as to why you are a good fit for the school and why that school is a good fit for your journey. Use this essay part 
        very wisely. Try to make it as genuine as possible without trying to sound as if you are the best of the best out there. <br><br>Most of the schools have articles and posts on 
        their websites mentioning what they are looking for in a candidate. So be thorough, visit your school website, look for pointers the admission committee might have added 
        somewhere and that will give you an idea as to what they are looking for in an ideal candidate.<br><br>Highlight your best features. You are as unique as any other candidate 
        out there so please don’t try to make your application a copy of any random sample you find online which claims they got in through this SOP. Even though it is the most cheesy 
        phrase out there, be yourself. explain your experience, your learnings and what makes you unique and how that uniqueness can contribute to the student body<br>
        <br>Lastly, keep it short, keep it precise. Your motivation should not be more than 1 page or in terms of words, not more than 800-1000 words<br>
        <br><strong>What matters most to you, and why? Tell us the values and experiences that have shaped the person you are</strong>(specific to ESSEC)<br>Now for this essay question, 
        dig deep and try to find that one instance, one event or even multiple if you want that shaped your values, your principles, just as the 2nd part of the question states 
        ‘Tell us the values and experiences that have shaped the person you are’<br><br><strong>Provide to the Admission Committee any relevant additional information (not already 
            detailed in the rest of your application)</strong>(specific to ESSEC)<br>Now when you come to this part, you might be thinking, Well I have basically mentioned everything 
            in the previous 2 essays so I’ll just skip this. No, that would be a mistake. Use this part to highlight any weakness, any gaps that you have in your profile that you couldn’t 
            justify anywhere else because of word limit. Treat this question in the same manner to maximize your chances.<br><br>
        </li><li><strong>GMAT/GRE Score + English Test Score</strong><br>A major part of your MiM application will be your Test Scores – Your management test score and your 
            English test score<br>Although ESSEC accepts all the 3 test scores – GMAT, GRE, and CAT, I would suggest you give the GMAT exam as that will help you later on during your 
            studies because some companies do ask for a GMAT score when you apply for a job and also when you apply for exchanges. Now, I was actually in a time crunch and only 
            studied for a month and got a score of 690 applied with that score. I have a video about that, 
            I’ll link it <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://youtu.be/PldcpmVFxU4" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>
            <br>To be on the safer side I would suggest applying with something more than a 690 but there will always be exceptions. In my batch, the min score is around 660 670 
            for the GMAT, 317 318 for the GRE, and around 95% overall for the CAT but everything else in their profile is just exceptional and top-notch. So, the most basic advice 
            here, try to score as much as possible<br><br>When it comes to the English Test score, many of us don’t check for a waiver – if we have done our bachelor’s from an English 
            speaking university, then we might not have to submit an English test score. So visit your school website and look if your school offers this exemption.<br><br>
        </li><li><strong>Academics</strong><br>Academics do play a good role as MiM is an early career degree and majority of the people applying are fresh out of college or with 
            just 1-2 years of work experience so your previous school academics are fairly recent and gives an overall accurate representation of your aptitude abilities in some 
            cases but if your score is low, it wouldn’t be a major hiccup, in my opinion, if you can showcase that you were focusing on various other things in college. 
            <br>Just to give you an example, I graduated MIT with a GPA of 7.01 out of 10, forget about exceptional, it might not even be considered average. You can definitely 
            overcome an average or a below-average GPA with a strong GMAT or GRE score and other aspects of your profile. <br><br></li>
            <li><strong>Extra Curricular</strong><br>You can make this part as extensive as you can, if you know how to play an instrument, add it, if you know how to sing, add it, 
                dance, artwork, design, sports, you were part of student bodies, add it, you can write, you can design websites, are good at photography add it. Basically, 
                anything apart from your college academics that you invest your time in, add it here. <br><br>In my case, I have been associated with Graphic Design for almost 8 
                years now and also have been doing some photography for quite some time. So, I mentioned these 2 parts and even provided the links to my different portfolios.<br><br></li>
                <li><strong>Work Ex</strong><br>Since MiM is focused on freshers and people with little to no work experience, this part isn’t much of a deal-breaker if you can justify 
                    your reason to join the MiM program right after your bachelor’s. Many B Schools do restrict you and wouldn’t let you apply if you have more than 2 years of work 
                    ex so check on your school website if that’s the case. At MIT, in my 2nd year, I got recruited into a start-up and was part of the design team, so that’s the first 
                    thing I mentioned. Apart from that, I obviously mentioned my post bachelor full-time work experience, being an analyst at Deloitte, working in the technology SAP. 
                    Since I had the brand name Deloitte, I surely leveraged that to make my application stronger and showcased important aspects of the role such as my role being 
                    client-facing which has basically enabled to interact with people from Germany, Singapore, etc hence I can very well gel with people coming from various 
                    backgrounds <br><br></li></ol> 
    <p>To conclude, I would say the application procedure sure does sound daunting at first, but it is very rewarding. <br>After going through the whole process, you will find so many things about yourself that you didn’t know before. </p>
    <p>And finally, when you receive that mail of acceptance, the whole process feels like the best part of it, you remember the moments you were scared, the moments you went blank and had no idea what to write. </p>   
    <p>Just one last point, I wanted to add here. There are many counseling agencies out there that can help with your application but, in my case, I wanted to go through the whole process all by myself so I did not opt for one. I trusted a few friends and my parents and showed them the essays I wrote and made edits based on their feedback. 
        As I haven’t been through the counseling process, I am not the right person to recommend if you should do it or not but if you ask me, I don’t think you need one.</p>
    <p>As always, this whole thing is also up there on YouTube as a video if you fancy consuming your content through a video:</p>
